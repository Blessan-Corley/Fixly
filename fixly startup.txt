fixly a starup project with nexjs tailwind mongodb and best production ready code and upstash redis and google location things 
 

first a good landing page where it has a good description and the things done by the fixly like that thigns and a good landing page impressive one with good wording s with humourous approach but good one and positive approach kind of things and the footer must contain a comprehensive set of footer link about us carrer page how it works how to get job how to post job nad some good set of comprehsive set of foolter links and good things also a help page and things to do faq page nad cookie prefrences page like that  with some good questions and answers like that make it good and working and comprehensive and good wordings adn things use type script and tsx and the things to make it all good sue the correct scheme and things make it good  
let me expllain in the landing page in the top right two
  button login signup and in the center f the page it has get started as only one button then after clicking the login button let
   it go to signin page where they can go with google login or email/username credentials login where the remember me check box
  should be not there where store the user tokken for 7 days and redirect directly to the dashboard without login that would be
  good then in the login forget ppassword where cllicking the redirects to forget password where there enter the email check it

  is a valid email or not and also check whether it is in the db as it was an existing user or not if yes send the email with otp cache it nad secure 
  for 5 minutes then after the if they enter the corect otp then let it be and let them change the password till then afer changing they
  should not change often so make it good ratelimit and use redis and things properly make it good then after that in the signup page
  let them select the role first hirer or fixer then after that both have same procedure of signup one things adds up for fixer
  is skill adding thats the only where both differs so let me continue explaining two signup method check whether the google
  llogin or email login is allreay a user in the db if yes then give a message that this email is already binded with another
  account try login instead like that message then redirect to login if it is new the webiste
   thenin the google login redirect to oauth then come back and do the things and fill the things if email login enter the email check
  the email is valid and not an exsisting user then send an otp let them fill the otp if it was sucessful then let them start
  filling the details as like the google login oth are smae kind of deatils adn things then after email verification in the any
  one of the authentication then step 1 let them write the password and confirm password things they can see the email in  the
  grey scale but cant change that then the step 2 is name and  user naem must be unique and lowercase validate it proerply and check
   whether the user name exsist or not in the realtime and give the feedback appropiately make it good then phone number which
  should not be binded before with any account so make it good and e them enter the 10 digits number and validate it properly
  then the last step skill and location for fixer location only for hirer make the skill selection good and also make the ux
  better to select not to overwheml them with too many skill section and things let them select and make it good and easy to selecting the list the skill all the available skills le them select from the  chips slection also have a search bar at the top to search
   dynamic search barthat woud be good and responsive then the main part location ask for gps and fill the address by
  automatically use the api or llet them selct the lcoatio in the map and le tit fill the address validate that it wont be away
  frmom the india make it good then the manual typing let them type use api to autofill if needed so make it good adn
  comprehensive and well implemented and also best ui and ux and feedbacka dn toast message and things make it all ggood then
  also after complemting all store these data in the db nad mkae it gooda then also with the aprox location nad also
  prescie location cuzwe need tham in the upcoming htings so make it good there are already pages and file but there are too
  many filea dn things and duplicates page and things remove thaose and ake it all robust and comprehsive also store things
  with meta data an enhance all make it good hope you can understand get the presice location and also aan aporx location too make it all good maybe i have said only some things implement all and make it all robust and make it good take your time and do it also make the ui and ux best and easy fill everything 

after completing the form redirect them to dashboard have Skelton loading thing or something use cache or something that will be good nad well implemented robust and good and in the dashboard beautiful dashboard with good naviagation things where it has seamless transitions subtle animation and hover effects subtle things not too annoyting ot things just make it right adn good so make it good with framer motion and other libraies and make it good 
then in dashboard  welcome username where it has time specific greeting good morning night owl good evening like that thing and a humourous single line thing below that make it good with good animation aand things and must be a user and must fill the signup signin and also have to be user to access the internall thigns of the website so make it good and working also make thigns work good together so hope you can understandwhat i expect from you then in the dashboard have a set of controls things and pages to navigater and use easy to use ui
 and ux and a comprehensive setting page with all features coustomizable things like that thing so make it good and a good profile page to change the things but should not able to change the user name other than that email changing must be done via otp thing so maek it good and a comprehsive profile apge 


and another thing is when showing confirmation box and modal dialog box or something popsup then blur the background a little subtle and good by this way that will be good 

and then the cookie thing after when user enters the website newly adn havnt done the cookie thing after entering the website after 5 to 10 secs show a popup in the bottom right corner with cookie related wording in it they cant clost the thing they have to accept it or they can read the cookie page and accept it like that so make it good and working good and store these details inthe mongodb and dont ask for cookie thing again only one time 


then another thing is have a realtime notifications things where it is realtime and the things from other side reaches thigs side comprehensively and also in a good notification style so make it good and also if user allows to send the notications send the push notifications too and also have the in website notications too with good mark as read thing and after cliking the specific notification it must redirect to the specific thing so make it all good and ready to use things with good ui ux design and things so go on and implement all proerperly make all good and realtime

and then another important thing is have a good pwa thing too user can downloiad the app as a pwa too as a native app feel best for mobile user where when the website founds after the login or signup if the user is from the mobile device have a banner or thing in the top which indicates to download this website as pwa things so that they can use as a native app make it good 

then in for the hirer they can see what are the applications are there for a specific job  the have posted and then what are the messages and other pages completed jobs expired job with repost capalities draft jobs and also in progress job assigned job like that things make it good and work good and comprehensive and robust then the main part is 

now the job posting thing first of all the hirer posts the job with a  good step by step form like thing easy to fill not over whemlming thing o do where the form consist of things like job title mandatory job description above 30 characters mandatory then then the job related skill selection where user can slect the related skills to the job where the fixer can see the matching capability of their skill set so then the next step is to select the attach the photo or videos must attach one photo to the job atleast then below the photo video uploading section below that materials bought by the hirer or not check box where it shows the material include by the hirer or not box and it mandatory to attach one photo so that only they can go to next step then then the timing things and the location thing where it shows the timing and the date thing must select a upcoming date and time the job need to be done within and the location have two buttons use my current location get the location and fill the address If not the another button is let them place the marker on the map and then let it fill after the marker is placed then another thing is to fill is let them enter the address check the entering address matches any of the address stored in location history or the home address if it matches list it below so that they can fill easily if not then let them enter it all manually and use google api to suggest the top location near them to fill it good so get the lcaotion these are mandatory let them then the next step is to select the urgency to select asap feature is blocked when the user is in free plan they have to be in pro plan to use the asap feature so that they can switch on  the asap feature if they have the pro plan then after all the things the budget selction in the same step where it has three options where the nogotiable , open to any or fixed if fixed then the user must enter the budget of their choice if nogitible they have to enter a budget too then if it is open to all then the budget becomes optional 
thye can fill or even they leave it to open for fixers then below it optional more 
text box to add they can add any text in the thing but all the text box should not contain any phonenumber content to be filled any things and also other than address filling thing in no other text box area the location details the phone number things and sensitive things should not be filled in any of the thing must ensure it cuz if they enter any contact details then they can contact with each other without needing of the fixly website so make sure you validate them silently if you find any then indicate it after clicking the finish button not at the raealtime cuz it will lead to spam or overuse of the api call thing so when clicking the next steo button indicate them that you have entered sensitive content remove that then continue doing it like that toast message then after removing them they can continue doing the things so validate them step by step then after completing they can click finish option to lock the things filled after cikcing the finish show a preview modal of the job
 they are going to post briefly the things they  filled and a small sizr of the photo they going to upload in the job posting show all the info they filled and after preview this in the bottom have a option to post eh job where in the near of that a toggle to turn on boost the job where turing on will reach the right fixer soon and will be at the top so that their job ill be finished quickly so also for that if they need to turn on it they have to be on pro plan to boost the job at the top so must ensure this so maek it good  aare going to post and all the things let tbe good also in the jonb losting in the bottom have option to mave through steps back and front step as they like and when clicking the finish validate all the things and if some thing has any issues then indicate with a good toast message and also indicate in the ui and ux so that they can indiafy the thing they have missed to fill like that make it gooda dn also mobile responsvively good also  in the bottom another option is that save as draft to store the draft of the psting thing in the draft page where they can view and edit draft form any time so that will be good and also an important feature place this button near the next button in the form so make it good when clicking the save as draft open  a model where it show are you sure to save it as draft adnd continue later ? this will be in draft for 7 days before auto delting then asl ohave auto save feature as they type it should save thigns realtime so that even though they miss or something happens they can continue where they left off then after finishing all the things they can post the job where free hirers can post only one job in every 4 hours where  the  timer start when a job is posted even if it is delete then the job needs to be posted after 4 hours so ensure to validate this then after posting successfully then it is visible to all the fixers in their browse job page according to the role urgency and the  boost job toggle if not let the job thing reach the fixer naturealy and good accoring  to the location sorting (if they allow the location if they didn't 
allow sort using the latest location in the location history array and even when there is no location history then use the home address which were gettedd when filling the signup form so based on the location they provide sort with it and show the distance from their location to the job location in the job rectangular box like card structure where fixer can see it where that thing has the job title before that the skill matching percentage and the matched skills show that and the time remaining if the job is expired mark it as red the border and indicate it as expired and don't show it to fixers remove from all the viewing thing and if the  job is going to reacht the dealine show a ornage color thing as the border or other clor to indicate it is going to end nad also in the rectangular card like thing for fixers to browse where it contins skill match and the tag where hirer slected nogotiable or opne for all thing and the fixed tag so display that then the title then the deadline time ramaing thing and the first onw or two lines of the descripition if possible then the date posted date and then the deadline date below it and also indicate whether it is edited by the hirer if the  job was edited by the hirer indicate to the fixer by marking it as edited make it good neat and subtle make it good and also in the show with a tag material included or not tag like thing or smething to indicate iif the materials are included slected b the hier and also display the price in the card if the budget is mentioned also below every job have the buttons comment section , then the view option where it shows the detailed all the things photos all the details of the job and all the things they can see it all very detailed and things the rectangular card is to provide just an over view of the job and also don't show the contect details sensitive location details phone number things or any other sensitive things in the job over view or even after cliking in the view button which opens a detailed view of the job don't show the sensitive details any 
where so make it good like that also the job posted by other hirer cannot seen by the other hirer only the hirer can see and manage their own job thing and comments message  nad the  all the fixer can see the job posted by the fixer but I will explain one by one first the comment section where all the fixer can see and comment under the job and the hirer who posted the job can comment and reply to the job where all the fixer and hirer can comment like and also reply to any like they like all realtime and well implement not delaying or refresh to see the changes ting all should work realtime and good all should be resposnsive and also the thing is beautiful animation to make feel live and the like should increase the count thing and make it all good and responsive like a innstagram like comment section where can reply to any comment they can and can like any comment in realtime so maek it good and also in the comment section while posting a comment the comment should not have any sensitive onfo about the job like location sharing phonenumber sharing or any kind of things hould be shared in the cokmment section location or any  other thing so make it good and working and validate things before posting  the the view option where the view option can used to view the detailed thing of the job and all only show the esstianial things and needed things for fixers to get impressed in the normal form and after clicking the view option show the detailed things of the job but don't show the sensitive details anytime so then I missed one thing when clicking the view details button increase the conut of the job view count where it is visible in the job preview rectangular preview nad also in the view thing views count increase it for the user id don't increase the  count when the user spams with one is and clicking multiple time just make it good where one view will be increase for one id or smething need to be unique so make it good and also then the nest button is apply button where it opens a form like thing to fill where if the budget is fixed the budget cannot be changed by the fixer let them apply with it but if the budget is contains the material cost too then there is nothing to change for this kind of job so just apply and preview the proposal form but can add optional text if they need to bu the text should not contain any location sharing things phonenynumber sharing things cvalidate it properly and must validate it shuld not able to proposaewith the sensitive details shoring in tit so make these things strict and tight in it so let them apply with it then the next possibility where negitiable with
 exsiting budget fixer can review the job needs adn things and then propose and new budget or if okay with the exsisting budget then fixer can apply to it straight if the materials isn't included then the fixer can propose a budget for material cost then in then in the then sum the total cost and also the bill like things material cost and the budget thing so that hirer can review the application then the last one open to any fixer will propose a budget as they like and also if the hirer didn't provide the materials fixer can provide a budget for the materials too like in the negotiable hope you can understand then after appliying the job goes to the applied state for that fixer only where other fixer still can apply to the job if they like to with their budget so then in the hirer job managing hirer can see the job thing where he can see the comment adn reply to it like to it nad also can review the proposal made by the fixer with the difference in the budget differebtiate it to make the ux and ui good so differentiate the budget and can review the job proposal and if the job proposal is good and the hirer can accept the job proposal and the other proposals came to the job will be deleted or go to the unviewabel accepteable state hope you can understand and the job status will go to assigned state  where the job will be assigned to the specific fixer then if the fixer is in the free plan then reduce the credits remaining by one and also only 3 jobs can be done via free jobs so the credits reduced one by one after each job assigned to the fixer with free plan then also if there is no credits left and the last credit is used user cannot see or use any of the things website restrict from sing things just diaply the thing to upgrade to pro plan to use the service continuely cannot able to see the job apply to job comment under job ot 
anything also when the last job is assigned to a fixer then delete unsend the the job proposal sent by the fixer which can cuade more jobs ti be assigned to him so make it good and handle all edge cases like this make thigns good then after the ob went to
 assigned mode then the job should be be shown to any other fixer anymore delte from public view then after it went toi assigned state then the pricate messaging thing will be introduced between the hirer and the specific fixer where they can chat send anything as they like to each where here there is no restrication they chat share file plan do work share location status and more they can do anything in there nad also the messaging system need to be realtime and well implemented make it all ogod realtime and the things should work great and realtime then when the messaging system open an automated message will be sent to the specific fixer with all the comprehensive details to the fixer like sensitive data phonenumber location full job descriotion job final budget everything will be shared as the first message to the fixer then both can talk from there in the private messaging then also show the realtime status at the top last online typing indicator all must work realtime in the chating system  make it good robust and comprehensive and also the ui ux of all the things must excel great and good the after assigned state after the fixer went to the job location and ready to start working then the fixer can change the jjob status to in progress state where hirer from the other end will check and inprogress state and confirms from their side too and mark as in progress state from hirer side make it all realtime and good then after the job is completed the fixer can mark the job as completed from the fixer side then 
can send the review for the fixer star rating thing and also optional description to the hirer and the job as they like the fixer can give rating to the hirer then in the hirer side the job will be marked as completed and the job will be marked and verified from both side as completed and will add to their respective things completed jobs and job history things and the hirer will give review ratings star ratings and then the descrption optional like that after both of them completed the job mark as completed then the review will be sent to the opposirte person via the job things and also iin thprivate messaging thing too and after completing the last message from both side will be the automatedly sent ratings thing where after bith side shared theier review it auto matedly sent tothe other side person and the chat will be closed means ewill be greyed and can jsut view only unable to send message and things also i forget to add when the ob is being posted make the first state as open or something but not relevant or confusingwith the open to any budget thing so make good and make oit good when the dealine is reached but still no fixer has been assigned to the job then the job geos to expired state where the hiere can repost the job if they neeed to with edited things or the same job again and aloswhile in open state the job can be edited by the hirer as they like but
 it will trigger the 4 hour job posting too so that the job must be posted oor edited once in the 4 hours for the free plan user even if they try to change or post anything prompt them to upgrade to use the thing so make it secure good and create a comprehsive plan work systematiacally and imppplement oneby one and make things work great cohensively this is the main thingsin this startup make it production ready and good go on make it ogod if you any wuestion feel free to ak me i am here to help this may have grammatical eroro adn also spelling mistake aske me if you could nt understand go on make plan and go on implement ine by one make the ui and
 ux good and work great and also easty to naviaate things easy to use ux and also make thigns comprehsive and all edge csses must be handled well gon take your time and implement all things should be reatime and good use the best libraies and tech things 	animate all good and subtle neat and good and professional make all good and easy to use and transitions and things make it good and also mainly the backend things need to be good and comprehensive and good then 

after a job is completed and marked as completed from both the sides then let them do the review things which good animations of and good hover effects and things make it all good and neat not too animated or annoying things make all good then hope you know the location htings location slector map thing i have set 5 api things in the google api key 

also create a good logo and things use good typography and color make it good and professional and easy too use ui and ux make things good then 

then another thing well secure and robust admin page to review all the activity and the admin can ban user if they need to if he find anny suspicious activity so make it good ban temp with auto timing to remove the ban and can ban premantly and other things too nad also good admin page with analytics and make all robust and comprehehsive 
also when an user is banned then they are not allowed to do anything in the website cannot navigate ot qanything till the break period so after login with the banned account details blur everytihing and show a unclosable modal pop up indiacteing the reason oif the ban from the admin then the realease date and the time left and then liks to contact like that thing 

also for all things use the +91 9976768211 and then the email address as blessancorley@gmail.com and also send the welcome email adn the otp email adn thenjob completion email like that things via email thing automated according to the things so make it good adn working

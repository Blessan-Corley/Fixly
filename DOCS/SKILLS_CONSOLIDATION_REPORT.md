## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Unified SkillSelector Features**
```javascript
<SkillSelector
  isModal={false}           // Works as modal or inline
  selectedSkills={[]}       // Currently selected skills
  onSkillsChange={fn}       // Callback for skill changes
  maxSkills={15}            // Maximum skills allowed
  minSkills={1}             // Minimum skills required
  required={true}           // Whether skills are mandatory
  className="w-full"        // Custom styling
/>
```

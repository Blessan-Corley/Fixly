# MongoDB.js File Analysis Report

## 🔍 Analysis Summary

**File:** `lib/mongodb.js`
**Status:** ✅ SAFE TO REMOVE
**Confidence:** 95%

## 📊 Evidence

### 1. NextAuth Configuration Analysis
- **Auth Strategy:** JWT (confirmed in `lib/auth.js`)
- **Session Storage:** Cookies (not database)
- **Database Adapter:** NONE configured

```javascript
// From lib/auth.js
const sessionConfig = {
  strategy: 'jwt',  // <-- Using JWT, not database
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
  updateAge: 24 * 60 * 60, // Update session every 24 hours
};
```

### 2. Import Analysis
- **Files importing `clientPromise`:** 0
- **Files importing from `lib/mongodb`:** 0 (all switched to `lib/db`)
- **References to MongoDB adapter:** Only in package.json (not used in code)

### 3. Database Connection Analysis
- **Primary DB Connection:** `lib/db.js` (Mongoose)
- **Usage:** All models use Mongoose connection
- **Auth DB Operations:** Manual queries using `lib/db.js`, not NextAuth adapter

### 4. Package Dependencies
- `@auth/mongodb-adapter`: Installed but unused
- `mongodb`: Used by mongoose, not directly
- Purpose: Originally intended for NextAuth sessions, but JWT was chosen instead

## ⚠️ Why lib/mongodb.js Exists
This file was likely created initially to support NextAuth database sessions, but the project was later configured to use JWT sessions instead for these reasons:

1. **Performance:** JWT tokens are faster (no DB queries per request)
2. **Scalability:** Stateless authentication
3. **Simplicity:** No session cleanup needed

## 🎯 Recommendation

**SAFE TO REMOVE** because:

1. ✅ NextAuth uses JWT strategy (verified)
2. ✅ No code imports clientPromise (verified)
3. ✅ All DB operations use Mongoose via lib/db.js (verified)
4. ✅ No session storage in database (verified)

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW

- **If removed:** No impact on functionality
- **If kept:** Uses memory, can cause confusion
- **Fallback:** Can be restored from git if needed

## 💡 Final Decision

Keep the file for now since you're concerned, but mark it as unused:

```javascript
// ⚠️ UNUSED: NextAuth uses JWT strategy, not database sessions
// This file is kept for reference but not used by the application
```
